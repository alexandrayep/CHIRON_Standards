Welcome to our catalogue of CHIRON standards, observed using Fiber mode. Almost all these standards have Teffs from the PASTEL catalogue, and all have well-measured radial velocities, preferentially from Nidever et al. (2002). All have relatively low vsinis. Metallicities, where available, are preferentially from Valenti & Fischer (2005). The properties of all standards are contained in _standards.txt. The key for numbered references in _standards.txt is contained in _refkey.txt.

Eight spectra (zet Oph, HD 215789, HD 30652, HD 10700, HD 16160, HD 9270, Theta Cet, and N Vel) are from Fred Walter.

Normalized versions (beta release) are available in the normalized folder. The blaze function, used to normalize orders of interest, is available as blaze.dat.

If you find this catalogue useful, please cite Yep & White (2020), in prep. If you have any questions about this catalogue, how to use our normalization procedure on your own CHIRON data, or anything else, you can email Alexandra Yep at ayep@astro.gsu.edu.

Slicer mode spectra are coming soon.
